                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Kachnar plant (Bauhinia variegata) is highly valued in traditional medicine, particularly in Ayurveda. Its flowers, leaves, bark, and roots offer numerous health benefits. Kachnar flowers are rich in antioxidants and are known for their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antimicrobial properties, which help boost immunity and fight infections. They are also used to improve digestion and aid in treating conditions like dysentery, diarrhea, and hemorrhoids. Additionally, Kachnar bark is traditionally used for managing thyroid disorders, as it is believed to balance thyroid hormone levels.

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Kachnar generally blooms in the spring, starting from February to April, when the weather is mild. During this time, the plant produces vibrant, pink-to-purple flowers that are not only beautiful but also edible and highly nutritious. Its flowering period lasts for several weeks, bringing a splash of color to gardens, parks, and natural landscapes. In warmer regions, the plant may flower as early as January. Once flowering is complete, it transitions to producing seed pods. The foliage remains green and lush through the summer and monsoon season, adding visual appeal to its surroundings year-round.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> The Kachnar plant is native to the Indian subcontinent, found abundantly across India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in regions with warm, moderate weather. Kachnar can be spotted in forests, open woodlands, and rural areas, as well as being commonly cultivated in urban parks and gardens due to its ornamental appeal. Beyond the Indian subcontinent, Kachnar is also grown in Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and Latin America, where the climate supports its growth. It adapts well to different soil types, making it a resilient plant for various environments.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Kachnar plants are hardy and long-living, with a typical lifespan ranging from 20 to 30 years. When grown under favorable conditions, they can even surpass this age. Young plants take around 3 to 5 years to reach maturity and begin flowering. As they grow older, Kachnar trees can reach up to 10-12 meters in height, developing a sturdy trunk and a broad canopy. These characteristics make it a popular choice for both decorative and functional planting, as its shade provides comfort in hot climates. With proper care, Kachnar plants continue to thrive and remain visually striking through their life span.</p>
